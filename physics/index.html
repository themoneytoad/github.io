        <p>Physics is where it all began, atleast for college.  I got my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering, then my Masters in applied physics, as well as my PhD all at the George Washington University.  Here I studied at the Micropropulsion and Nanotechnology Lab under Professor Michael Keidar.</p>
        <p>My research was in electric propulsion for small satellites.  The technology was built, and demo'd on a few satellites that are still orbiting the Earth at the time of this writing, 2022.  Though one or two of them are floating garbage... But don't mind that! They will burn up... eventually.</p>
        <p>Some fun things that happened with this research was working with NASA Ames in the Northern California Bay Area, to develop the technology and try and get it on a demonstrator cube satellite.</p>
        <p>Not only did we work with NASA Ames, but we also worked with NASA Goddard, to fly another join mission with South Korea's Yonsei University on the CANYVAL-X mission.  Was a first glimps into more professional research and developments, and was a fun mission to be apart of.</p>
        <p>Electric propulsion will always hold a special place in my heart.  Plasma is a fascinating subject, one that I emplore anyone with an interest to go research on their own.  Not only are there many interesting applications to plasma, but many great inventions that have benefited society are based on plasma.  Plus the multitude of hypersonic research coming out is one field I have an interest in.  One day... who knows.</p>
