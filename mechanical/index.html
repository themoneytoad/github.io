        <p>There isn't much to chat about other than the variety of projects that I want to discuss, and various fun things I have gotten to work on over the years.  Throughout my career at the George Washington University, I had the privilage of spending time with the machine shop machinists.</p>
        <p>Tom and Bill were major influence in my life, and they taught me alot about how to properly plan and build things.  Many little tid bits that they painfully learned over the years, allowed me to get a quick jumpstart into proper machining methedologies.  Things you wouldn't think about unless you spent time to physically build stuff with your hands.</p>
        <p>Due to my many hours spent in the shop, I was fortunate enough to work on a variety of things.  Alot of which was using their laser cutter.  That was a godsend, that unlocked alot of things.  Things from science experimental setups, coasters, to the height of my mechanical design of a 13th centruy spit jack.  A mechanical rotisserie device, that you crank up a weight with your hand, and gravity takes over to spin the cogs.  I made it to pay a family friend of mine to be the chef for my wedding.</p>
        <p>It really was a fun project, that took most of my talents.  Working with lathes, mills, the laser cutter, TIG welding, etc.  A great blend between wood working and metal working.  Luckily I have the drawings for the gears, and all the gear ratios I used.  I suppose I will just need access to another laser cutter to make another.  With improvements of course.</p>
        <p>Programs used have been Solidworks for mechanical engineering work.  If one needs simulations done, using official software suites are clearly advised.  I've done well with Blender3D.  The gears for the spitjack were all done in Blender.  That and 3D Printing various models and parts for satellite concepts, or just fun random objects.  Blender3D is an amazing tool.</p>
